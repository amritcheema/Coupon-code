# About Coupon-code
Custom code for FormidablePro Coupon Code

#Why i need this?
Formidable coupon code only works on one field means on final total amount, but my requirement was to apply some discount only on specific fields like tour price, flights price etc. So, after applying coupon code on tour price only this field get discounted but total price was remain same as before before applying coupon code.

#How it works?
Intially, getting actual value of discounted fields when coupon code comes in focus.
Then get discounted value.
get the difference between them
Apply that discount on as many field as you needed.

#Only Javascript/JQuery
